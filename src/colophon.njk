This website was created from scratch with love, on an old but trustworthy gaming laptop. It is written in HTML, Markdown, Nunjucks, CSS, and Javascript.

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) is used for static page generation. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is used for version control. [Github](https://github.com) is used to store the repository. This site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

The primary serif typeface is [Work Sans](http://weiweihuanghuang.github.io/Work-Sans/) by Wei Huang. The text has a 5:1 contrast ratio at Level AA or better, as specified by [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).    
    
I used [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for development; [Chromium Nightly](https://www.chromium.org/Home/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) were used for testing.
