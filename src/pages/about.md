I'm a web developer, documentation specialist, business analyst, a few other adjectives and roles, close confidante of the Round Table knights, freelance worldsaver, lentil enthusiast.

Having received my Master's degree in 2021, I have worked in the industry as a web designer and front-end developer. Every year or so, my domain `parth.ninja` points to a fresh redesign of this personal website. This online project will act as a portfolio / journal for my unusually frequent adventures.

I'm currently located in Portland, OR.

  Like most delicious recipes and dishes, I believe websites are made by carefully choosing a few simple ingredients and preparing them with great gusto.For a quick summary, take a look at this [portfolio gallery of my latest projects](/menu) disguised as a restaurant menu card!
