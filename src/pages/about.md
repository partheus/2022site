I'm a web developer, documentation specialist, business analyst, a few other adjectives and roles, close confidante of the Round Table knights, freelance worldsaver, lentil enthusiast...

Having received my Master's degree in 2021, I have worked in the industry as a web designer and front-end developer. Every year or so since 2017, my domain `parth.ninja` points to a fresh redesign of this personal website. As of now, this online project will act as a portfolio / journal for my unusually frequent adventures.

I'm obsessed with audiobooks, as evidenced by my [weekly checkouts](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/60162168-parth-shiralkar?shelf=audiobook) at the Multnomah County Central Library. I live in Portland, OR, and work with a wonderful design studio as a frontend developer. View my [code](/code).
